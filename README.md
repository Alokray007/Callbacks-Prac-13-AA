Callback Problems
It's time to get some practice using callbacks!

Complete the problems in the order specified.

To run the tests for the above problems you will need to unzip the file you downloaded.

To get started, use the following commands:

cd into the project directory
npm install to install any dependencies
npm test to run the test cases
The npm test command will run all the tests. If you have any trouble with this don't hesitate to ask a TA for help!

P.S. You may notice the package.json/package-lock.json files and node_modules directory. You do not need to edit any of those contents. Those files are what we use to package the project and create the test cases.

When you finish your project, don't forget to add your project to your Github!

Initialize the local directory
Add and commit your project
Push the project to the repo you created
